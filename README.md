E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes sales data from an e-commerce database with customers, products, orders, and order items. The goal is to find insights about revenue, popular products, and customer behavior.

The database tracks customer details like names, email, location, and signup date. Products have names, categories, prices, and stock information. Orders record total amounts and dates, and order items track products and quantities in each order.

The analysis identifies the top customers by total spending, calculates overall revenue, finds revenue by product category, and shows the best-selling products. This helps understand customer preferences, business trends, and product performance.

Observations show that some products and categories generate more revenue than others, and the top customers contribute significantly to sales. These insights can guide marketing, inventory, and business decisions.

This project demonstrates the ability to organize data, analyze trends, and communicate findings clearly. It highlights skills in data analysis and problem-solving with real-world business data.
